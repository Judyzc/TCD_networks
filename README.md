- super rough, check out packets.py. Run with ```python packets.py``` or ```python3 packets.py```. currently, packet building, sending, and environment simulation all in there. will move out into separate files later. a lot of code is built with help from genAI, so mostly its just for reference/outlining the concept
- utils.py is for various utility functions, currently using the @timefunc wrapper to just keep track of function timing 
- the ./randompractice folder is just for more reference code and isn't used by our actual ```packets.py``` file.
